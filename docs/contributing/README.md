# Contributing to Draft

Here you'll find documentation geared towards leaning about the development process for the Draft project itself and how you can contribute.

- Draft over time: [Semver Contract][semver] | [Deprecation Timeline][deprecation]

Draft is a community effort. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help others. As soon as you learn Draft, you can contribute in many ways:

- Join the #draft-users Slack channel on https://kubernetes.slack.com and answer questions. By explaining Draft to other users, you’re going to learn a lot about the tool yourself.
- Blog about Draft. We syndicate all the Draft blogs we know about on the [topics page](../topics/README.md); if you’d like to see your blog on that page you can add it there.
- Contribute to open-source Draft projects, write some documentation, or release your own code as an open-source plugin. The ecosystem of plugins is a big strength of Draft, help us build it!
