# Security Policy

Most of the time, when you find a bug in Draft, it should be reported using GitHub issues. However, if you are reporting a security vulnerability, please email a report to one of the core maintainers directly. This will give us a chance to try to fix the issue before it is exploited in the wild.

Core maintainers of Draft can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/draft/blob/master/OWNERS).
