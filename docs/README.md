# Draft documentation

Everything you need to know about Draft.

## How the documentation is organized

Draft has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things.

[Tutorials][] take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a web application. Start here if you’re new to Draft or cloud-native development. Also have a look at the “First steps” below.

[Topic guides][] discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

[How-to guides][] are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Draft works.

[The Reference guides][] (known as Draft Enhancement Proposals, or DEPs for short) contain technical references for many aspects of Draft's architecture. They describe how Draft works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

[Contributing guides][] teach you about the development process for the Draft project itself and about how you can contribute.
